## Motivation

## Background and Motivation

Inequality has recently risen again in many countries. Even for those countries that have seen some encouraging declines in trends, inequality remains high and even on the rise again for some. (Chancel et al. 2022).

--

One common concern is that inequality may be unfairly due to potential lack of equal opportunities, instead of differences in individual efforts. 

A concept central to **American Dream**: Equality of Opportunities. 



---

## Background and Motivation

Snapshot of .red[**cross-sectional**] inequality is not sufficient to characterize the equality of opportunities, or the actual extent of inequality. 


.blue[**Measurements of .red[Narrow] IGM**]: 

- **Narrow**: .blue[**Correlations**] between child income and parental income.

    1. log-log regression
    2. Rank-rank regression


---

## Background and Motivation

### .red[Narrow] measurement of .red[Narrow]  Concept

.blue[Empirical Facts]: Strong dependence or correlation are regarded as indicating immobility,

1. In the U.S., estimates range from 0.2 (Behrman and Taubman, 1985) to 0.6 (Mazumder, 2005) to .34 Chetty et al. (2014)
2. In China, Fan et al. (2021)  0.390 for the 1970- 1980 birth cohort (pre-reform cohort) to 0.442 for the 1981-1988 birth cohort (post-reform cohort).

Mazumder (2018) surveying the field:

&gt;Where exactly the United States and other countries lie on this spectrum has been a central question in
the intergenerational income mobility literature."

---
## What are the conventional approaches missing?

Other than intergenerational mobility elasticities (and mixing time concepts), it is not always straightforward nor intuitive to interpret the correlations estimates without a particular context.

.center[### .red[Singular estimate of IGM is useless]]

1. .blue[One group] In the U.S., estimates range from 

  + .34 Chetty et al. (2014): rank-rank regression
  + .6 (Mazumder, 2005): log-log regression

--

1. .blue[Between Group] A comparative (between-group) analysis of IGMs is also required for a better and deeper understanding of mobility, as well as monitoring progress in mobility and assessment of the policies (.blue[treatment effects]). 

---

The literature has indeed explored .blue[between-group] heterogeneity: influential examples:

--
1. Geography (cross country or region)

  - welfare-state economies such as Denmark and Noway have higher levels of mobility than more market-oriented economies such as the United States (e.g., Landers  and Heckman (2017), Solon (2002))
  
  - South is less mobile than West Chetty et al. (2014)
  
  - The Great Gatsby Curve Krueger (2012)
--

1. Race

  - Blacks are less mobile than Whites Chetty et al. (2020)

--

1. Race and Geography (Jonathan Davis and Mazumder, 2020)

--

1. Time

  - Mobility has decreased over time (Mazumder, 2019)


---

## Background and Motivation

.blue[Empirical Regularities]: **The Great Gatsby Curve**

![](figures/fig-great-gatsby.png)

---
## First Goal

To challenge the usefullness and even meaning of these measures as a policy metric, and validity of comparisons between groups. 


---
## What are these approaches missing?

.blue[Heterogeneity] of families: Nonlinearity and Heterogeneous Dependence Across the distribution, as predicted by economic theories: 

--

1. **Poverty Trap** Becker and Tomes (1979) and Loury (1976): highlight family income as a key constraining factor in human capital formation, which implies a strong persistence in the lower tail of the distribution and gives rise to poverty traps.

--

2. **Nonlinear IGM** Durlauf, 1996b; Durlauf, 1996a: Focusing on provision of public goods, role model, and peer effects, social theories of intergenerational mobility mimic the Becker-Tomes environment that is highly nonlinear and can also produce poverty traps. (Durlauf et al. 2017, **Threshold effects**)

--

3. **Affluence Trap**: Becker et al. (2018) by emphasizing complementarities in the production of children's human capital, show that a strong intergenerational persistence in incomes can exist, even in the absence of credit constraints, and that mobility is low in the upper part of the income distribution


---
## What are these approaches missing?

**True Model**:

 `$$Y=g(X)+\epsilon$$`, 
 
where `\(Y\)` and `\(X\)` are the logarithm of child and parental income, respectively, `\(g(\cdot)\)` is an unknown function. 

The derivative, `\(g^{\prime}(x)\)` is the slope which measures persistence, interpreted as the inverse of mobility at a particular level of parental income `\(X=x\)`, and `\(\epsilon\)` is an error term.

---

## Problem

.red[**Scalar measures**] or **Aggregation** is inevitable, especially for policy metrics and between-group analysis ([Inevitability here](#np); [Sen  (1995)](#sen))

.blue[**Within one group**] `$$m^1_{A} \quad ?&lt; \quad ?= \quad ?&gt;m^2_{A}$$`


.blue[**Comparative analysis**]

`$$m_{A} \quad ?&lt; \quad ?= \quad ?&gt;m_{B}$$`
--
.red[**Question:**] 

What do these scalar measures mean in the presence of .blue[**heterogeneity**]?

--- 
## Questions to be answered

### 1. Conventional Measures: What do we know about them? .blue[Statistical Criterion]

  1. What are the aggregation or weighting schemes underlying these measures?
  1. Are these aggregation or weighting schemes sensible? Why or why not?
  1. How may they affect our understanding of immobility?

### 2. What is Our Solution? .blue[Economic Criterion]

1. What would be a more general approach to justify or accommodate varying weighting schemes?

# Part I
##Starting Point: Weighted Average Representation


---
## Summary

1. Linear regression, a linear projection of nonlinear process, is a special form of aggregation or weighting schemes.

1. Rank-rank regression, is a special form of aggregation or weighting schemes.

$$
\int w(x) g^{\prime}(x) d x
$$

---
## Basic Results


`$$\beta_{OLS}=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{X}} w(x) g^{\prime}(x) d x$$`
where `\(w(x)&gt;0, \int_{\mathcal{S}_{X}} w(x) d x=1\)`, and

`$$w(x)=\color{red}{F_{X}(x)}\color{blue}{[\mathbb{E}(X)-\mathbb{E}(X \mid X \leq x)]}\color{green}{(\operatorname{Var}(X))^{-1}}$$`
--

**Conclusion:** maximized at the .blue[sample median]


---
## Basic Results

.blue[Weighted Average Representation of Rank-Rank] in terms of `\(\color{red}{g^{\prime}(\cdot)}\)`, as opposed to `\(g_{\mathbf{\color{blue}{r}}}^{\prime}(u)\)`

**Proposition**

`$$\beta_{r}=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{X}} w\left(F_{X}(x)\right) g_{r}^{\prime}\left(F_{X}(x)\right) f_{X}(x) d x=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{X}} w_{r}(x) g^{\prime}(x) d x$$`

where
`$$w_{r}(x)=\frac{\color{red}{6\left(F_{X}(x)-F_{X}^{2}(x)\right)f_{X}(x)} \color{blue}{g_{r}^{\prime}\left(F_{X}(x)\right)} }{\color{green}{g^{\prime}(x)}}$$`

--
1. `\(w_{r}(x)\)` .red[**is not proper weight**]. In general, `\(\int_{\mathcal{X}} w_{r}(x) d x \neq 1 ; \beta_{r}\)` can be greater than `\(\max g^{\prime}(x)\)` if `\(\int_{\mathcal{X}} w_{r}(x) d x&gt;1\)`

2. `\(N_{r}(x)\)` is .red[**not necessarily maximized at the median**] of `\(X\)`. It depends on `\(g^{\prime}(\cdot), g_{r}^{\prime}(\cdot), f_{X}(\cdot)\)`

---
## Basic Results

We derive the weighting functions of rank-rank regressions for three special cases:

1. Uniform: maximizes at the median
2. Normal: in general, not at the median
3. Log-normal: in general, not at the median

--

.red[Main Message:] 

1. Measures driven by .blue[statistical criterion] are not desirable. 

1. Level regression is bad, Rank-rank regression is worse.

## .red[Question]: What to do?

---
name: alt-sol

## A Less Elegant Solution

One may be tempted to estimate the entire non parametric function `\(g(x)\)`, as well as `\(g^{\prime}(x)\)` first and then impose a particular weighting scheme. This is, however, theoretically and computationally unappealing.

1. The nonparametric function estimates have a very slow rate of convergence, and the derivatives are even slower.
2. Performances are sensitive to the choice of regularization like kernel and bandwidth choice.
3. computationally involved and can be impractical at moderate sample sizes and imprecise with small samples such as the panel data like PSID

# Part II:
## A General Theory of Mobility Measures Based on Social Preferences

---
class: middle center

###One-step approach: .blue[Nonparametric] + .red[Social Welfare Function]

---
## Adavantages of Our approach

1. We can incorporate any typical social welfare functions in estimation 

1. Our approach is straightforward, avoiding the first-stage estimation and in practice is equivalent to the IV estimator.

1. The practical advantage of our approach is thus enormous, it allows the practitioners to easily vary the parameters to assess the sensitivity of the results and therefore focus on the issue at hand.

---
## Unified Framework

Yaari (1987, 1988) show that a preference relation, `\(P(\cdot)\)`, defined on income distribution, which satisfies a set of standard axioms, can be represented by the following social welfare

$$
W_X = \int x d P \left(F_X(x)\right) = \int_0^1 P^{\prime}(t) F_X^{-1}(t) dt
$$

where `\(F_X^{-1}(t)\)` is the `\(t\)`-th quantile of the income distribution. `\({ }^{13}\)` Social welfare `\(W_X\)` is taken as a weighted average of individual incomes in which the weight `\(P^{\prime}(\cdot)\)` is a function of income ranks `\(t \in[0,1]\)` with `\(P(0)=0, P(1)=1\)` and `\(P^{\prime}(t)&gt;0\)`. 

.blue[Our measure]

$$
s=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(Y, P^{\prime}\left(F_X(X)\right)\right)}{\operatorname{Cov}\left(X, P^{\prime}\left(F_X(X)\right)\right)}=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(Y, P^{\prime}(U)\right)}{\operatorname{Cov}\left(X, P^{\prime}(U)\right)} .
$$
---
## Economic Interpretations

The proposed mobility measures here comport with "ideal measures" of mobility discussed in the literature (e.g., see Atkinson (1980), Markandya (1982), King (1983), Maasoumi (2020))

.blue[Proposition 2.] For the mobility measure s, we obtain the following properties:


`\(s=\widetilde{W}_Y\left(\widetilde{W}_X\right)^{-1}\)` can be interpreted as the marginal effect of parents' normalized social welfare 


`\(\widetilde{W}_Y=\int_{\mathcal{S}_X} \widetilde{y}_x d P\left(F_X(x)\right)\)` on children's normalized social welfare `\(\widetilde{W}_X=\)` `\(\int_{\mathcal{S}_X} \widetilde{x} d P\left(F_X(x)\right)\)`, where `\(\widetilde{y}_x=\mathbb{E}(Y \mid X=x)-\mathbb{E}(Y)\)` and `\(\widetilde{x}=x-\mathbb{E}(X)\)` are children's normalized conditional income and parents' normalized income, respectively.

---

.blue[Proposition 3]. The summary measure of mobility can be rewritten as

$$
s=\int w(x) g^{\prime}(x) d x
$$
where the underlying weight scheme satisfies `\(w(x)&gt;0, \int w(x) d x=1\)`, and

$$
w(x)= \frac{P(F_X(x))-F_X(x)}{\int P(F_X(t))-F_X(t) d t}
$$

---
## Economic Interpretation of Regression-based Measures

.blue[Proposition 4]. If the evaluation function is `\(P(t)=\int_0^t F_X^{-1}(u) d u\)`, then `\(s=\beta\)`, where `\(\beta=\operatorname{Cov}(Y, X) / \operatorname{Cov}(X, X)\)`. 


However, the fact that `\(P(t)\)` is **convex** implies that the policy maker is not equality minded, and the evaluation fails to satisfy the PigouDalton principle of transfers.


---
## Social Welfare Functions and Corresponding Measures of (Im)Mobility

We consider the weighting schemes based on the commonly used social welfare functions:

**Class 1: Gini Function** 
`$$P_{k}^{I}(p)=1-(1-p)^{k} \text { for } p \in[0,1]$$`
where `\(k&gt;1\)` is the inequality aversion parameter. The higher `\(k\)`, the more inequality averse the society and more weights `\(\left(d P_{k}^{I}(p) / d p\right)\)` placed on the poor.

--

**Class 2: Lorenz Function**
$$
`\begin{aligned}
&amp;P_{v}^{II}(p)=\left(v p-p^{v}\right)(v-1)^{-1} \text { for } p \in[0,1], v&gt;0, \text { and } v \neq 1 \\
&amp;P_{1}^{II}(p)= \begin{cases}p(1-\log p) &amp; \text { if } 0&lt;p \leq 1 \\
0 &amp; \text { if } p=0\end{cases}
\end{aligned}`
$$


---
## Class 1: Gini-based Mobility Measures

.blue[Preference Function]
$$
P_{k}^{I}(p)=1-(1-p)^{k} \text { for } p \in[0,1]
$$

.blue[(Im)Mobility Measure]

`$$s^{I}(k)=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(Y,\color{red}{\left[1-F_{X}(X)\right]^{k-1}}\right)}{\operatorname{Cov}\left(X,\color{red}{\left[1-F_{X}(X)\right]^{k-1}}\right)}$$`

where `\(\color{red}{\left[1-F_{X}(X)\right]^{k-1}}\)` is proportional to `\(\frac{d}{du} P_{\kappa}^{I}(u) =\kappa(1-u)^{\kappa-1}\)` the preference derivative, the weight placed on a particular income. 

---
## Class 2: Lorenz-based Mobility Measures

.blue[Preference Function]

$$
`\begin{aligned}
&amp;P_{v}^{II}(p)=\left(v p-p^{v}\right)(v-1)^{-1} \text { for } p \in[0,1], v&gt;0, \text { and } v \neq 1 \\
&amp;P_{1}^{II}(p)= \begin{cases}p(1-\log p) &amp; \text { if } 0&lt;p \leq 1 \\
0 &amp; \text { if } p=0\end{cases}
\end{aligned}`
$$
.blue[(Im)Mobility Measure]

`$$s^{II}(v)=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(Y, \color{red}{1-F_{X}(X)^{v-1}}\right)}{\operatorname{Cov}\left(X, \color{red}{1-F_{X}(X)^{v-1}}\right)}$$`

where `\(1-F_{X}(X)^{v-1}\)` is proportional to the preference derivative, `\(\nu\left(1-u^{\nu-1}\right)(\nu-1)^{-1}\)`.

## Part III: Data


---
name: data

## Data Source: Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); Total family income.

We are convinced by all the papers written by Mazumder that this is the dataset!

1. The long panel structure allows us to match children to their parents for intergenerational analysis, as well as to obtain their incomes at a wide range of stages over the life-cycle for both generations.

1. Include only the Survey Research Center component of the PSID, but exclude the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) component to prevent over-representing the poverty sample.

1. (the logarithm of) permanent incomes for both children and parents. the average of annual family incomes, which include the taxable income of all earners in the family, from all sources, and transfer payments. center the average around age 40 (between 30 and 50) choice of age 40 follows the rule of thumb in the literature that largely overcomes the life cycle bias (Haider and Solon (2006); Mazumder (2018b)).

1. We exclude zero and negative incomes. [Zero Income](#zeroincome)

## Part IV: Results

## Results Summary

1. The results are sensitive to the approaches used.

2. Even the relative magnitudes. In some cases, the patterns are even reversed.

3. The results are not monotonic, suggesting that the underlying process is indeed nonlinear and non-monotonic.

1. Regression suggests a less mobile society in general than rank-rank regression does.
2. Common pattern: South is less mobile and West is more mobile
3. Difference: North Central is less mobile (regression), while more mobile (rank-rank regression)

## Decision-theoretic Gini-based Measures

1. Suggest rather nonlinear process

1. Not always monotonic

1. Asymmetric association across regions. (In the West, poorer individuals are less more mobile.)



---
## Conclusions

1. We discuss a new and challenging issue in measuring mobility, especially in the presence of heterogeneity and the context of group comparisons.

2. We derive the (lackof) justification of the underlying aggregation function for dominant approaches in practice

3. We propose two different classes of decision-theoretic measures of mobility, both are rather easy to compute in practice using any statistical softwares.

4. Using our results, we indeed find the results are sensitive to the changes in the weighting functions and the parameters of the welfare functions.

## Permanent Income

Milton Friedman had to revise his "operational" definitions of his permanent income three times.
1. Permanent income is affected by the permanent components whose effects on income last more than a certain period of time (Friedman and Kuznets (1945)).
2. Permanent income is the amount that a consumer unit can consume while wealth remains intact: `\(y_{p}=i W\)` (from Friedman (1957)).
3. Permanent income is estimated by a weighted pattern of past income adaptive expectations (Friedman `\((1957,1963)\)` ).

## Inevitability of Summary Measures

1. Policy metrics or evaluation requires a before- and after comparison. 

1. Nonparametric models, by definition, have an infinite number of parameters, and in practice, you can present and compare a few. 

1. Nonparametric models or the true models may not have discernable patterns for comparison. 

1. More importantly, how to compare between groups? Deeper issue
  
  - at the same level of level? They have different meanings for different groups
  - at the same rank? They are not necessarily comparable other than their position in their respective group 
  
(similarly in the context of gender and racial gap, model or forecast performance)

## Average Method

We can do that, but why?

Amartya Sen (1995): Inequality Reexamined
&gt; egalitarianism, the effect of ignoring the interpersonal variations can, in fact, be deeply inegalitarian, in hiding the fact that equal consideration for all may demand very unequal treatment in favor of a particular group. The demands of substantive equality can be particularly exacting and complex when there is a good deal of antecedent inequality to counter.

Such methods are not necessarily consistent with typical social welfare functions, where we often care more about children from disadvantaged families. 

In the presence of heterogeneity, we often bring different approaches to summarize the distribution and never focus on the mean income. This is evident when we are thinking about the .blue[**The Great Gatsby Curve**].

## A Numerical Example of the Problem

## Class 1 (Gini-based): Properties of Weighting Functions

**Proposition:** Class 1: Gini-based Mobility Measures We obtain the following properties:

1. `\(p^{I}(k)\)` (.blue[**maximum weight**] the peak or turning point) is strictly decreasing in `\(k\)` for `\(k&gt;1\)`.
2. `\(\lim _{k \rightarrow \infty} p^{I}(k) \rightarrow 0\)`.
3. For a sufficiently large `\(k, w_{k}^{I}(p) \approx c^{\prime}(k)(1-p)\)` for almost `\(p\)` (.blue[**monotonically decreasing weights**]).

**Proposition:** Class 2 Mobility Measures We obtain the following properties:
1. `\(p^{II}(v)\)` (.blue[**maximum weight**]) is strictly increasing in `\(v\)` for `\(v&gt;0\)`.

3. For a sufficiently small `\(v, w_{v}^{\prime \prime}(p) \approx c^{\prime \prime}(v)(p-1)\)` for almost `\(p\)`; (.red[**monotonically decreasing weights**]) for a sufficiently large `\(v, w_{v}^{II}(p) \approx c^{II}(v) p\)` for almost `\(p\)` (.red[**monotonically increasing weights**]).
4. For `\(v=1\)`, the turning point is `\(p^{II}(1)=e^{-1}=0.368\)`.

## Model and Estimation

`$$Y=g(X, Z)+\epsilon$$`

`$$s^{I}(\kappa, z)=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left(Y,\left[1-F_{X \mid Z}(X \mid Z)\right]^{\kappa-1} \mid Z=z\right)}{\operatorname{Cov}\left(X,\left[1-F_{X \mid Z}(X \mid Z)\right]^{\kappa-1} \mid Z=z\right)}$$`

**Nonparametric Covariance Regression**

where `$$Q_{i}^{Z}=\left[1-F_{X \mid Z}\left(X_{i} \mid Z_{i}\right)\right]^{\kappa-1} \text { and } \widehat{Q}_{i}^{Z}=\left[1-\widehat{F}_{X \mid Z}\left(X_{i} \mid Z_{i}\right)\right]^{\kappa-1}$$`

## Model and Estimation

`$$\widehat{s}^{I}(\kappa, z)=\frac{\widehat{\operatorname{Cov}}\left(Y, \widehat{Q}^{Z} \mid Z=z\right)}{\widehat{\operatorname{Cov}}\left(X, \widehat{Q}^{Z} \mid Z=z\right)}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_{h}\left(Z_{i}-z\right)\left(Y_{i}-\widehat{\mathbb{E}}\left(Y_{i} \mid Z_{i}\right)\right)\left(\widehat{Q}_{i}^{Z}-\widehat{\mathbb{E}}\left(\widehat{Q}_{i}^{Z}\right)\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_{h}\left(Z_{i}-z\right)\left(X_{i}-\widehat{\mathbb{E}}\left(X_{i} \mid Z_{i}\right)\right)\left(\widehat{Q}_{i}^{Z}-\widehat{\mathbb{E}}\left(\widehat{Q}_{i}^{Z}\right)\right)}$$`

We can establish the asymptotic normality for our estimator.

## A Unified Framework for Decomposition

**Unconditional Mobility**
`$$\bar{s}_{A}^{I}(\kappa)=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{Z^{A}}} s_{A}^{I}(\kappa, z) f_{A}(z) d z$$`
`$$\bar{s}_{B}^{I}(\kappa)=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{Z^{B}}} s_{B}^{I}(\kappa, z) f_{B}(z) d z$$`

--
**Counterfactual Mobility**

`$$\bar{s}_{c}^{I}(\kappa)=\int_{\mathcal{S}_{\mathbf{\color{red}{Z^{B}}}}} \mathbf{\color{blue}{s_{A}^{I}(\kappa, z)}} \mathbf{\color{red}{f_{B}(z)}} d z$$`
--
**Decomposition**
`$$\bar{S}_{A}^{I}(\kappa)-\bar{S}_{B}^{I}(\kappa)=\underbrace{\left[\bar{S}_{A}^{I}(\kappa)-\bar{S}_{c}^{I}(\kappa)\right]}_{\text {Composition Differences }}+\underbrace{\left[\bar{S}_{c}^{I}(\kappa)-\bar{S}_{B}^{I}(\kappa)\right]}_{\text {Process Differences }}$$`

## PSID vs Administrative data

First, the family total income in the PSID includes sources of income such as transfers that are not available in the administrative tax record, and it is still reported "even when it may be too low to be filed for tax purposes" (An et al., 2020). 

Second, the PSID has a better coverage of life-cycles than the administrative records. Therefore, very few instances of zero incomes exist in the PSID, and the instances of multiple years of zero incomes are even rarer. 

Mazumder (2016) concludes that 

&gt; "the concerns about the sensitivity of results around how to handle years of zero income is effectively a non-issue when using family income."

## Before Conclusions

The results here, both theoretical and empirical, may be uncomfortable for some. 
--

The ubiquitous heterogeneity and nonlinearity may imply that any conclusions regarding the mobility can be subjective and sensitive to the varying parameter. However, some of the **qualitative** conclusions do not have to be. 

--

It is important to see what consensus may arise from this kind of analysis. When no uniform conclusions can be reached, our paper points out the need to explicate the commitment to certain policy goals when measuring mobility. 

For example, many may agree that the measurement of mobility should reflect our care for the poor, and that monitoring the changes or policy effectiveness should place more weights on the children from more disadvantaged families. Only when such qualifying statements are made can our policy discussions be more meaningful and fruitful.
